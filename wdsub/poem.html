    <blockquote style="font-family: Papyrus, cursive">
    <span style="text-decoration: overline wavy purple 1px ">Well I saw the <span>thing comin' out of the sky<br>
It had the one long horn, and one big eye<br>
I commenced to shakin' and I said "Ooh-eee"<br>
      It looks like a <span style="color:purple; font-style: italic">purple</span> people eater to me<br>
      â€¦ It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' <span style="color:purple; font-style: italic">purple</span> people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
      A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' <span style="color:purple; font-style: italic">purple</span> people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
