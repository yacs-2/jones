Only the Tibetan macaque and a few of the gray langurs can rival its size.Sexual dimorphism is pronounced in the species. Males have a head-body length of 26.0 to 30.0 in and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Proboscis_monkey_%28Nasalis_larvatus%29_male_Labuk_Bay_2.jpg/640px-Proboscis_monkey_%28Nasalis_larvatus%29_male_Labuk_Bay_2.jpg" id="monkeypic">typically weigh 35 to 50 lb, with a maximum known weight of 66 lb. Females measure 21.0 to 24.4 in in head-and-body length and weigh 15 to 26 lb, with a maximum known mass of 33 lb.
The proboscis monkey has a long coat; the fur on the back is bright orange, reddish brown, yellowish brown or brick-red.[ The underfur is light-grey, yellowish, or greyish to light-orange.Infants are born with a blue coloured face that at 2.5 months darkens to grey. By 8.5 months of age, the face has become cream coloured like the adults. Both sexes have bulging stomachs that give the monkeys what resembles a pot belly. Many of the monkeys' toes are webbed.</div> <div style="text-align:center"id="Headline2"><h2>The Capuchin Monkey</h2></div><div class="article">The capuchin monkeys are New World monkeys of the subfamily Cebinae. They are readily identified as the "organ grinder" monkey, and have been used in many movies and television shows. The range of capuchin monkeys includes some tropical <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Capuchin_Costa_Rica.jpg/640px-Capuchin_Costa_Rica.jpg" id="monkeypicdos">forests in Central America and South America as far south as northern Argentina. In Central America, where they are called white-faced monkeys, they usually occupy the wet lowland forests on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama and deciduous dry forest on the Pacific coast.The word "capuchin" derives from the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, who wear brown robes with large hoods. When Portuguese explorers reached the Americas in the 15th century, they found small monkeys whose coloring resembled these friars, especially when in their robes with hoods down, and named them capuchins. When the scientists described a specimen they noted that: "his muzzle of a tanned color, with the lighter color around his eyes that melts into the white at the front, his cheeks give him the looks that involuntarily reminds us of the appearance that historically in our country represents ignorance, laziness, and sensuality. The scientific name of the genus, Cebus comes from the Greek word kêbos, meaning a long-tailed monkey.</div> 
  <div style="text-align:center"id="Headline3"><h2>The Tamarin Monkey</h2></div><div class="article">The tamarins are squirrel-sized New World monkeys from the family Callitrichidae in the genus Saguinus. They are the first offshoot in the Callitrichidae tree, and therefore are the sister group of a clade formed by the lion tamarins, Goeldi's monkeys and marmosets. Hershkovitz (1977) recognised ten species in the genus Saguinus, further divided into 33 morphotypes based on facial pelage. A later classification into two clades was based on variations in dental <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Tamarin_portrait_2_edit3.jpg/640px-Tamarin_portrait_2_edit3.jpg" id="monkeypictres">measurements. A taxonomic review (Rylands et al., 2016) showed the tamarins are a sister group to all other callitrichids, branching off 15–13 million years ago. Within this clade, six species groups are historically recognised, nigricollis, mystax, midas, inustus, bicolor and oedipus, five of which were shown to be valid with Sanguinus inustus placed within the midas group. The review noted that the smaller-bodied nigricollis group began diverging 11–8 million years ago, leading the authors to move them to a separate genus, Leontocebus (saddle-back tamarins). While a 2018 study proposed that Leontocebus does not have sufficient divergence from Saguinus to be in its own genus, and thus should be reclassified it as a subgenus of Saguinus, this proposal has since found significant traction. The same study found the mystax group of tamarins to be distinct enough to be classified in the subgenus Tamarinus. As of 2021 this proposal has not been universally accepted by primatologists.</div> </div> <div id="footer"><div id="publish-info">
